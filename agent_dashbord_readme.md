# 👑 CEO Master Console
## The Central Intelligence Hub (8-Agent System)

The **CEO Master Console** is the primary dashboard and control plane for your multi-agent ecosystem. Built with Python and Tkinter, it provides a visual interface to monitor, trigger, and approve actions across all specialized "worker bots."

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Unified Agent Dashboard:** A high-visibility GUI that displays the status of all eight agents (CEO Router, Dev Manager, Email, Cyber, Security, Graphics, Red Team, Software Eng).
* **AI-Driven Routing:** The "CEO Router" automatically interprets your natural language commands to delegate tasks to the correct agent.
* **CEO Security Gate:** Implements a strict "Human-in-the-Loop" approval system for sensitive tasks, featuring a dark-themed pop-up, JSON-parsed risk analysis, and Text-to-Speech (TTS) alerts.
* **Integrated Voice Command:** Built-in microphone support allows you to command the fleet using natural language.
* **Pipeline Orchestration:** Can spin up automated pipelines (DevSecOps) and background tasks (Email Auto-Sweep) without freezing the main interface.
